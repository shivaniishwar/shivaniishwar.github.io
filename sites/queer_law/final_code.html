      <div class="description">People of marginalized sexual orientations have
        fought to be treated equally under the law for much of modern history.
        While queer rights causes have gained popularity and earned successes
        over the years, the truth is that queer people still face great
        inconsistencies in legal rights and protections depending on the simple
        fact of where they live. This project is an exploration of the variations
        in how queer lives are governed around the world.</div>

      <p class="descriptionSmall">There are a few factors that affect who is
        impacted by the laws represented in these charts. Some places
        criminalize certain "unnatural" sexual activity regardless of the
        participants' genders. Some places don't allow single people to adopt
        children, whether they're queer or not.</p>
      <p class="descriptionSmall">In addition, getting data on who identifies
        as queer (or any other identity label) can be tricky. Some might choose
        not to self-report on surveys, because of fears of social stigma. Others
        might not identify a certain way at the time of surveying, but may change
        their labels later.</p>
      <p class="descriptionSmall">For these reasons, the population numbers shown
        by these charts represent the entire population of the places that have
        each law in effect, not just a subset that might identify as queer.</p>

      <p class="descriptionSmall">Some areas of the world are considered much
        more queer-friendly than others, but some places defy those expectations
        (in good or bad ways). While we may consider "developed" and "developing"
        parts of the world as distinct, monolithic regions, there is a lot of
        variation within those categories.</p>
      <p class="descriptionSmall">The Global North, or "first world," is
        typically associated with progressive ideals; meanwhile, the Global
        South, or "third world," may be viewed in less flattering light.</p>
      <p class="descriptionSmall">But in terms of laws governing queerness,
        the places appearing on these lists might subvert our preconceived ideas
        about the world.</p>
