      <p class="mt-4">"Bandh," a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandh" target="_blank">Hindi and Urdu word</a> meaning "close" or "shut down," is a decades-old form of protest originating in South Asian countries like India and Nepal. It calls for all workers — shopkeepers, bus drivers, even schoolteachers — to stay home and not report for work.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">In India, when such protests are called nationwide, it's referred to as a "Bharat Bandh" — "Bharat" being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" target="_blank">Hindi word for India</a>. Following in the legacy of Indian protesters like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" target="_blank">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, these nationwide strikes are a peaceful but powerful way for Indians to respond to political events, from the passage of new laws to mass violence.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 st">the farmers' movement</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">58 percent of India's population, over 800 million people, <a href="https://www.ibef.org/industry/agriculture-india.aspx" target="_blank">rely on agriculture</a> for their primary source of income, whether they are <span class="u1">farmers</span> or work <span class="u2">elsewhere</span> in the industry. And unlike in many countries, the vast majority of those people operate small-scale farms, averaging <a href="http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/culture-miscellaneous/difference-between-indian-farmer-and-u-s-farmer/" target="_blank">about 2 hectares (5 acres)</a> in land.</p>
      <svg id="no1"></svg>
      <div id="tt1" class="tt"></div>
      <p class="mt-4">But very little of that money ultimately goes to the farmers themselves. While a small minority of farmers achieve financial success, the vast majority struggle with poverty; it's tragically common for small-scale farmers to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5419010/" target="_blank">commit suicide</a>, seeing no other way out from underneath massive amounts of debt.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">For decades, India's government has set <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-basis-of-msp-6609668/" target="_blank">"Minimum Support Prices"</a> for certain crops to subsidize the cost of growing them. Essential crops like <span class="u1">rice</span>, <span class="u2">lentils</span>, <span class="u3">sesame</span>, and <span class="u4">cotton</span> add the equivalent of hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars to the value of the Indian economy. For farmers who grow these crops, MSPs ensure a certain amount of profit regardless of their yield; but farmers who don't grow any of the subsidized crops aren't protected by the system.</p>
      <svg id="sm"></svg>
      <div id="ttsm" class="tt"></div>
      <p class="mt-4">In 2020, the government introduced three laws that were intended to reform the agricultural sector; among other changes, these laws meant that the MSP system would be abandoned altogether.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Rather than moving to support more of India's farmers, this was widely viewed as a step in the wrong direction. Many farmers feel that they will be left unprotected by their government, and that private corporations will be able to take advantage of their vulnerable positions to drive crop prices even lower.</p>

      <p class="mt-4">Since August 2020, farmers all over the country, but particularly from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, have come together to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/india-s-farmers-are-protesting-authoritarianism-disguised-capitalism-sound-familiar-ncna1258028" target="_blank">protest against these laws</a>. Farmers and other laborers in the agricultural sector have organized strikes, marches, and collective actions for months.</p>
      <svg id="no2"></svg>
      <div id="tt2" class="tt"></div>
      <div id="b1" class="blurb">
        <strong>SEPTEMBER 25, 2020:</strong> Farmers nationwide organized protests after the agricultural laws were passed through India's legislature, but before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was due to sign them. Though these demonstrations drew international attention, Modi still signed the laws on September 28, three days later.
      </div>
      <div id="b2" class="blurb">
        <strong>DECEMBER 8, 2020:</strong> Agricultural workers, with the support and solidarity of other labor organizations, organized a "Bharat Bandh." This became the biggest single day of action, with an estimated 250 million people participating.
      </div>
      <div id="b3" class="blurb">
        <strong>FEBRUARY 6, 2021:</strong> Protesters organized a three-hour "chakka jam," blocking national and state highways to demand action from the government.
      </div>
      <div id="bn" class="blurb">
        <strong>MARCH 26, 2021:</strong> To mark four months of protest in Delhi, protesters organized another "Bharat Bandh." While it wasn't the biggest event in the farmers' movement, it marked a moment of solidarity from other trade unions, which also wanted to protest high fuel prices.
      </div>
      <h4 class="mt-4 st">who's involved?</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">Out of a total 4,201 protests associated with this movement from August 9, 2020 until the present, the <a href="https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard" target="_blank">ACLED</a> reports that the vast majority of them have been <span class="u1">peaceful</span>. About 8% have been <span class="u2">vio</span><span class="u3">lent</span>, while just one protest was reported as being met with <span class="u4">"excessive force."</span></p>
      <svg id="no3"></svg>
      <div id="tt3" class="tt"></div>
      <p class="mt-4">On the surface, this may seem like an impressive ratio. But it's unclear what the ACLED defines as "excessive" — given that the farmers' demands have been about legislation, and the vast majority of protesters have <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/india-protesting-farmers-met-with-police-violence-at-delhis-red-fort/" target="_blank">remained non-violent</a> except in cases where police or government interventions were present, one might consider any amount of force directed against them as "excessive."</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Even setting aside direct physical violence, the Indian government has been <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/02/india-government-must-stop-crushing-farmers-protests-and-demonizing-dissenters/" target="_blank">openly hostile</a> to the farmers' movement, threatening and arresting peaceful protesters and even branding them as anti-Indian terrorists. The government even went so far as to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/02/twitter-suspends-hundreds-of-indian-accounts-after-government-demand" target="_blank">suspend Twitter accounts</a> that were Tweeting in favor of the protests. Though Twitter later reversed this ban, it was a worrying example of the government silencing unfavorable political opinions.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Let's take a look at how much two Twitter hashtags, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BharatBandh" class="u1" target="_blank">#bharatbandh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FarmerProtest" class="u2" target="_blank">#farmerprotest</a>, have been used during this movement.</p>

      <p class="mt-4">It's important to note that these Tweets represent all uses of the hashtags in question — not just positive ones. There are plenty of outspoken opinions, both in favor of and against the farmers' movement, using these keywords to gain attention.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">But the fact is that thousands of people, both in India and abroad, have given their attention to the farmer's movement. Even celebrities and activists, like <a href="https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/1356625889602199552" target="_blank">Rihanna</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1356694884615340037" target="_blank">Greta Thunberg</a>, have shown their support and solidarity. This international attention even prompted the Indian government to <a href="https://mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/33456/Press_Statement_on_recent_comments_by_foreign_individuals_and_entities_on_the_farmers_protests" target="_blank">admonish "foreign individuals and entities"</a> for meddling in Indian affairs.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 st">the biggest protest in history?</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">In total, during the Bharat Bandh on December 8, 2020, an estimated <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/indian-farmer-strike-largest-protest-history-us-world-pay-attention-2020-12" target="_blank">250 million workers</a> — both farmers and other laborers in solidarity with the movement — shut down the country. This has been widely cited as the "biggest protest in history," surpassing India's own record set in 2016.</p>

      </figure>
      <p class="mt-4">Let's take a look at how the <span class="u1">farmers' movement</span> compares to other protest movements in recent history. In India, a previous <span class="u2">national strike</span> drew international attention <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/business/bharat-bandh-today-lukewarm-response-nationwide-as-18-crore-workers-go-on-strike-2987418.html" target="_blank">in 2016</a>. In France, the <span class="u5">Yellow Vests movement</span> drew crowds <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/france-protests-yellow-vests-today/" target="_blank">from late 2018 to early 2019</a>. And as many Americans remember, <span class="u4">Occupy Wall Street</span> took over New York City <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/what-is-occupy-wall-street-the-history-of-leaderless-movements/2011/10/10/gIQAwkFjaL_story.html" target="_blank">in 2011 and 2012</a>.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Though these movements have their differences, they each grew out of discontent among the working class. From farmers to service workers, these movements have represented a struggle for equity and against class divisions.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="mt-4">Similarly to the farmers' movement, all of these movements have spread information and garnered attention online. Let's take a look at how certain hashtags have been used in association with these movements.</p>
      <svg id="no6"></svg>
      <div id="b6" class="blurb">
        <strong><span id="pt3"></span></strong><br/><span id="pt4"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-4">Despite much higher in-person participation numbers in both Indian protests, their Twitter presences are dwarfed by the amount of attention given to the Yellow Vests movement. Given that Twitter didn't have as many users a decade ago as it does today, even the Occupy movement's numbers seem more impressive than those of the farmers' movement.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Part of this could be due to the disparities between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_South" target="_blank">Global North and South countries</a>: what some might call the "developed" versus the "developing" world. People in India are much less likely to have consistent electricity, Internet access, and Twitter accounts than those in France and the U.S. The farmers' protest as well as the 2016 national strike are both primarily associated with laborers, who often live in poverty — this could correlate with the amount of attention from people able to Tweet. In addition, India's track record of banning government dissent on Twitter could lead to a hesitance to post opinions online.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Finally, a much more subtle issue is the idea that international attention, both positive and negative, might be more focused on major protests in the Global North. Because we view Europe and North America as largely "developed," increased attention may be given to protests and upheaval. Meanwhile, from outside of a "developing" nation like India, some may consider it less unusual, and less worthy of attention, when people protest — even on such a large scale.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 st">what comes next?</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">Despite meeting <a href="https://theprint.in/india/eleventh-round-of-talks-between-modi-govt-and-farmers-fails-no-date-for-next-meeting/590520/">many times</a> over the months to try to settle their differences, the farmers' movement and the Indian government have not reached an agreement. Leaders in the movement insist they will not settle for anything less than a full repeal of the agricultural laws, while the government hasn't offered anything more than an 18-month suspension of the laws.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">As time goes on, both national and international attention is beginning to fade. Without a resolution, these protests may be doomed to a slow, silent end. But farmers on the front lines remain hopeful that they can persuade the government to yield to their demands. They will stay at this for as long as it takes, planning <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-farmers-protest-to-continue-its-long-march-into-summer/378859">new protests</a> to go into the summer.</p>
      <p>As India deals with rapidly escalating cases and deaths due to COVID-19, the farmers involved in protesting are putting their lives <i>and</i> livelihoods on the line. It's difficult to tell whether their sacrifices will pay off.</p>
