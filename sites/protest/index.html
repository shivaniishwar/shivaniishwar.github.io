      <h1>Bharat Bandh</h1>
      <h3>a data-driven exploration of the Indian farmers' movement of 2020-2021</h3>
      <p class="mt-4">[explanation of "bharat bandh," history of protest and labor movements in india]</p>
      <p class="mt-4">58 percent of India's population, over 800 million people, rely on agriculture for their primary source of income. And unlike in many countries, the vast majority of those people operate small-scale farms, averaging <a href="http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/culture-miscellaneous/difference-between-indian-farmer-and-u-s-farmer/">about 2 hectares (5 acres)</a> in land. Essential crops like rice, wheat, sugarcane, and cotton add the equivalent of hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars to the value of the Indian economy.</p>
      <svg id="no1"></svg>
      <div id="tt1" class="tt"></div>
      <p class="mt-4">But very little of that money ultimately goes to the farmers themselves. While a small minority of farmers achieve financial success, the vast majority struggle with poverty; it's tragically common for small-scale farmers to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5419010/">commit suicide</a>, seeing no other way out from underneath massive amounts of debt.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">For decades, India's government has set "Minimum Support Prices" for certain crops to subsidize the cost of growing them. For farmers who grow these crops, MSPs ensure a certain amount of profit regardless of their yield; but farmers who don't grow any of the subsidized crops aren't protected by the system.</p>
      <svg id="sm"></svg>
      <div id="ttsm" class="tt"></div>
      <p class="mt-4">In 2020, the government introduced three laws that were intended to reform the agricultural sector; among other changes, these laws meant that the MSP system would be abandoned altogether. Rather than moving to support more of India's farmers, this was widely viewed as a step in the wrong direction.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4 st">the farmers' protests</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">With the removal of what is widely seen as a safety net, India's farmers feel that they will be left unprotected by their government, and that private corporations will be able to take advantage of their vulnerable positions to drive crop prices even lower.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Since August 2020, farmers all over the country, but particularly from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, have come together to protest against these laws. Farmers and other laborers in the agricultural sector have organized protests and collective actions for months.</p>
      <svg id="no2"></svg>
      <div id="tt2" class="tt"></div>
      <div id="b1" class="blurb">
        <strong>SEPTEMBER 25, 2020:</strong> Farmers nationwide organized protests after the agricultural laws were passed through India's legislature, but before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was due to sign them. Though these demonstrations drew international attention, Modi still signed the laws on September 28, three days later.
      </div>
      <div id="b2" class="blurb">
        <strong>DECEMBER 8, 2020:</strong> Agricultural workers, with the support and solidarity of other labor organizations, organized a nationwide strike, or "Bharat Bandh." This became the biggest single day of action, with an estimated 250 million people participating.
      </div>
      <div id="b3" class="blurb">
        <strong>FEBRUARY 6, 2021:</strong> Protesters organized a three-hour "chakka jam," blocking national and state highways to demand action from the government.
      </div>
      <h4 class="mt-4 st">who's involved?</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">Out of a total 4,217 protests associated with this movement from August 9, 2020 until the present, the ACLED reports that the vast majority of them have been peaceful. About 9% have been violent, while just one protest was reported as being met with "excessive force."</p>
      <svg id="no3"></svg>
      <div id="tt3" class="tt"></div>
      <p class="mt-4">[critique the definition of "excessive force"]</p>
      <p class="mt-4">In addition to those who have physically been present at the farmer protests, there has also been a massive online response. In particular, Twitter has been known as a way for protesters to organize, publicize their movements and demands, and gain support from the broader public.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Let's take a look at how much two Twitter hashtags, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BharatBandh" id="u1">#bharatbandh</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FarmerProtest" id="u2">#farmerprotest</a>, have been used during this movement.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4 st">the biggest protest in history?</h4>
      <p class="mt-4">In total, during the Bharat Bandh on December 8, 2020, an estimated 250 million workers — both farmers and other laborers in solidarity with the movement — shut down the country. This has been widely cited as the "biggest protest in history," surpassing India's own record for another national strike in 2016.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">How do these participation numbers stack up against other labor movements that have gained international attention in recent history?</p>

      </div>
      <p class="mt-4">All of these protests have, to a degree, spread information and garnered attention online. So, compared to the volume of Tweets associated with the farmers' protest, how much Twitter attention was devoted to the other movements in their heyday?</p>
      <svg id="no6"></svg>
      <div id="b6" class="blurb">
        <strong><span id="pt3"></span></strong><br/><span id="pt4"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-4">Despite much higher in-person participation numbers in both Indian protests, their Twitter presences are dwarfed by the amount of attention given to the Yellow Vests movement. When you consider the popularity of Twitter during 2011 and 2012, even the Occupy movement's numbers seem more impressive.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Part of this could be due to the disparities between Global North and South countries: what some might called the "developed" versus the "developing" world. People in India are much less likely to have consistent electricity, Internet access, and Twitter accounts than those in France and the U.S. The farmers' protest as well as the 2016 national strike are both primarily associated with laborers, who often live in poverty — this could correlate with the amount of attention from people able to Tweet. In addition, India has cracked down on people expressing anti-government opinions on Twitter, including journalists covering the farmers' protests in the past year. This could lead to a hesitance to post opinions online.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">Finally, a much more subtle issue is the idea that international attention, both positive and negative, might be more focused on major protests in the Global North. Because we view Europe and North America as largely "developed," there may be some bias in the amount of attention protests and upheaval receive. Meanwhile, from outside of a "developing" nation like India, some may consider it less unusual, and less worthy of attention, when people protest — even on such a large scale.</p>
